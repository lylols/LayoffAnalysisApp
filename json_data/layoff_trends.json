                        "answer": "Yes, major layoff events coincided with stock market dips, especially for tech companies. These layoffs were often seen after sharp drops in company valuations. Many companies used workforce reductions to signal a focus on profitability to investors. In some cases, this boosted short-term stock performance. However, long-term confidence usually depended on restructuring effectiveness. Thus, layoffs both influenced and were influenced by market trends."

                        "question": "Were there industries consistently impacted year over year?",
                        "answer": "Yes, technology and retail have consistently faced layoffs across the past three years. This reflects both over-expansion and shifting customer behavior. Recurring layoffs indicate structural issues or outdated business models in these sectors. In particular, the retail sector faced rising e-commerce competition and changing consumer preferences. Tech firms, meanwhile, were affected by hiring booms that outpaced demand. As markets corrected, these industries struggled to stabilize. Some industries are in prolonged transition, not temporary crisis."

                    {
                        "question": "What might justify such large layoffs in one go?",
                        "answer": "Companies often restructure for cost-saving, adopt automation, or respond to declining revenues. Mass layoffs are usually strategic and aimed at improving financial efficiency. In some cases, they prepare the firm for acquisitions or investor pressure. The trend is especially common in tech, where rapid scaling is followed by rapid downsizing. Firms reassess talent needs in light of new technologies or shifting priorities."

                        "question": "Did these layoffs align with earnings reports?",
                        "answer": "Yes, many layoffs were announced shortly before or after poor quarterly earnings. Companies tend to time these announcements to signal action to shareholders. Poor financial performance forces leadership to take decisive measures. Layoffs can help boost stock sentiment in the short term. However, repeated layoffs may erode employee morale and public trust."
