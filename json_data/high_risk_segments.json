            "question": "Why are repeated layoffs concerning for stakeholders?",
            "answer": "Repeated layoffs are troubling because they suggest a deeper underlying issue within the company. This could point to flawed strategic direction, poor financial planning, or ineffective leadership. For investors, such patterns erode confidence and may lead to stock volatility or withdrawal of funding. Employees may face constant job insecurity, leading to decreased morale and higher attrition of top talent."

          {
            "question": "Are such companies able to recover operationally after such massive cuts?",
            "answer": "Recovering after large-scale layoffs is challenging and varies by company. While some manage to streamline and regain focus post-restructuring, others continue struggling due to lost talent and reputational damage. Operational recovery also depends on how layoffs were handled—transparent communication and employee support can ease transitions. Additionally, companies with solid business models and strong market demand tend to bounce back faster."

          {
            "question": "Why do some industries face consistent layoffs?",
            "answer": "Industries like tech and retail face consistent layoffs due to rapid changes in consumer trends and digital disruptions. In tech, overhiring during boom periods often leads to mass corrections during downturns. Retail suffers from shifting buyer preferences, e-commerce pressure, and seasonal variability. Such structural factors make these industries more volatile in terms of employment stability."

          },
          {
            "question": "Why do early-stage startups face higher layoff volatility?",
            "answer": "Early-stage startups often operate on limited financial runways and depend heavily on investor funding. When expected rounds are delayed or missed, cutting workforce becomes a survival tactic. Additionally, their business models are often untested, making them prone to pivot frequently. This leads to rapid changes in team needs and frequent restructuring, resulting in more layoffs."
